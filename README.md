        <p>The BMI calculator is a web application that helps users assess their body composition by calculating their Body Mass Index (BMI). It considers the individual's weight in relation to their height to determine the level of body fat. By providing a convenient way to calculate BMI, users can gain insights into their weight status and identify if they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.</p>
